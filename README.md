Developed using [**electron-react-boilerplate**](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate)

## Installation

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hcuffy/My-Marks
```

And then install dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd marks
$ yarn
```

## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

Alternatively, you can run the renderer and main processes separately. This way, you can restart one process without waiting for the other. Run these two commands **simultaneously** in different console tabs:

```bash
$ yarn start-renderer-dev
$ yarn start-main-dev
```

If you don't need autofocus when your files was changed, then run `dev` with env `START_MINIMIZED=true`:

```bash
$ START_MINIMIZED=true yarn dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ yarn package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,

```bash
$ yarn package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ yarn package -- --[option]
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ yarn build
$ yarn test-e2e

# Running e2e tests in a minimized window
$ START_MINIMIZED=true yarn build
$ yarn test-e2e
```

:bulb: You can debug your production build with devtools by simply setting the `DEBUG_PROD` env variable:

```bash
DEBUG_PROD=true yarn package
```

## How to add modules to the project

You will need to add other modules to this boilerplate, depending on the requirements of your project. For example, you may want to add [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) to communicate with PostgreSQL database, or
[material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/) to reuse react UI components.

⚠️ Please read the following section before installing any dependencies ⚠️

### Module Structure

This boilerplate uses a [two package.json structure](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Two-package.json-Structure). This means, you will have two `package.json` files.

1.  `./package.json` in the root of your project
2.  `./app/package.json` inside `app` folder

### Which `package.json` file to use

**Rule of thumb** is: all modules go into `./package.json` except native modules, or modules with native dependencies or peer dependencies. Native modules, or packages with native dependencies should go into `./app/package.json`.

1.  If the module is native to a platform (like node-postgres), it should be listed under `dependencies` in `./app/package.json`
2.  If a module is `import`ed by another module, include it in `dependencies` in `./package.json`. See [this ESLint rule](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-extraneous-dependencies.md). Examples of such modules are `material-ui`, `redux-form`, and `moment`.
3.  Otherwise, modules used for building, testing and debugging should be included in `devDependencies` in `./package.json`.

### Further Readings

See the wiki page, [Module Structure — Two package.json Structure](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/wiki/Module-Structure----Two-package.json-Structure) to understand what is native module, the rationale behind two package.json structure and more.

For an example app that uses this boilerplate and packages native dependencies, see [erb-sqlite-example](https://github.com/amilajack/erb-sqlite-example).

## CSS Modules

This boilerplate is configured to use [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) out of the box.

All `.css` file extensions will use css-modules unless it has `.global.css`.

If you need global styles, stylesheets with `.global.css` will not go through the
css-modules loader. e.g. `app.global.css`

If you want to import global css libraries (like `bootstrap`), you can just write the following code in `.global.css`:

```css
@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```

## Sass support

If you want to use Sass in your app, you only need to import `.sass` files instead of `.css` once:

```js
import './app.global.scss';
```
